## Project : File IO and Exceptions
### Author: Doha Khamaiseh

### Setup :
*I installed .venv and activated it by using these commands: python3 -m venv .venv, source .venv/bin/activate  , also store the dependencies in  requirements file by using this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt*


### I run my code using this command on terminal : python madlib_cli/madlib.py where madlib_cli is a directory and madlib.py is where I wrote the code

### Tests :
I created a test.txt file and append to it all values user entered then read by using  read_template function then parse them to stripped and parts values where the stripped has the text without the user values and parts has just the user values by using parse_template function then mergethe them again by using merge function
